BUGS
====
- The option -snp also omits the searches in the defined fonts, rather than only omitting the searches in the user's system that are not pre-defined in config.h, fix.

FEATURES
========
- Add an option for limiting the text search to start from the beginning of the item, i.e. the line.
- Add wildcard and/or regex support.
